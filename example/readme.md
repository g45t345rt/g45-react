# Example project using g45-react package

Check `package.json` scripts for how the bundler works.  

## Note

This example is using npm install symlink to connect the g45-react package.  
For this reason, `react`, `react-router-dom` and `react-helmet-async`
are also symlinked directly.  
This is not needed when you install the package the traditional way.
